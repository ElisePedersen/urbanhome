# UrbanHome

This is my submission for the second semester project at Noroff. This project covers planning, designing, creating Strapi API and building the website. The assignment was to create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of this project. 

## Description

UrbanHome is an e-commerce website where the user can 
- see a list of featured products on the homepage
- see a list of all the products on the products page, in addition to searching for a product
- see the product details on the products details page
- add products to the cart and see the cart page

On the admin section, a logged in user can create, update and delete products.

## Frameworks and Libraries
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Strapi API
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts

## Hosting Services
- Netlify

## Installation and Setup
To run the project locally, close this repository to your computer and open it with your code editor. You can launch the website in you browser through Live Server, which has a live reload feature. 

### Admin
To login to the admin pages you need to use this username and password:

Username: `admin@admin.com`

Password: `Pass1234`

### To run the local version of Strapi

Due to changes in HerokuÂ´s policies, it is now neccesary to run a local version of Strapi in order for the project to work. An example Strapi repo can be found [here](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-sp2-v4).

- Clone the repo [here](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/strapi-sp2-v4)
- Open a terminal in the project
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run develop`

Now, you can access the server at [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) or access the administration panel at [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin).
